# Revnet

This repo provides tools for deploying Revnets: Retailistic networks, using the Juicebox and Uniswap protocols for its implementation.

For a Retailism TLDR, see https://jango.eth.sucks/9E01E72C-6028-48B7-AD04-F25393307132/.

In this repo, you'll find:
- a basic revnet design implemented in `BasicRevnetDeployer`.
- a design that accepts other pay hooks implemented in `PayHookRevnetDeployer`, which accepts other pay hooks that'll get used throughout the revnet's lifetime as it receives payments.
- a design that supports tiered 721 pay hooks implemented in `Tiered721RevnetDeployer`, which accepts data to deploy a tiered 721 pay hook that'll get used throughout the network's lifetime as people pay in, alongside other pay hooks that may also be specified.
- a design supports croptop, implemented in `CroptopRevnetDeployer`, which accepts data to deploy a tiered 721 pay hook that'll get used throughout the project's lifetime as people pay in that can also be posted to by the public through the croptop publisher contract. See https://croptop.eth.limo for more context.

You can use these contracts to deploy treasuries from etherscan, or wherever else they've been exposed from.

## Install

For `npm` projects (recommended):

```bash
npm install @bananapus/721-hook
```

For `forge` projects (not recommended):

```bash
forge install Bananapus/nana-721-hook
```

Add `@bananapus/721-hook/=lib/nana-721-hook/` to `remappings.txt`. You'll also need to install `nana-721-hook`'s dependencies and add similar remappings for them.

## Develop

`nana-721-hook` uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for package management and the [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) development toolchain for builds, tests, and deployments. To get set up, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
```

You can download and install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install && forge install
```

If you run into trouble with `forge install`, try using `git submodule update --init --recursive` to ensure that nested submodules have been properly initialized.
